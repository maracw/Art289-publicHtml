            <p>When I was a grad student in Communication, I used to introduce myself as a Fan of Fans.
         True, I did fan studies (and queer media studies). Also, that was a way of talking about teaching and researching where I wanted investment rather than distance.</p> 
         <p>In end, I left grad school without a PhD. The only thing I wanted about an academic life was a Big Dog. It turns out, you don't need a PhD to have a big dog!</p>
         <p>
            After working a fancy job where I learned a lot of Excel tricks, I decided to come back to school to learn Computer Programming. It turns out, I like it a lot. I like math too. 
         </p>
       
         <p>My work as an illustrator is not the same as drawing for myself. On most
            nights, I draw on my tablet while watching (or re-watching) science
            fiction and fantasy tv shows. I draw animals, fan art, gifts for friends,
            plants, etc.</p>
            <p>I like to crochet and I have a lovely stash of soft, colorful yarn. Also, I
            bake often. You should check out some of my recipes at <a>Butter Mountain</a>.</p>
