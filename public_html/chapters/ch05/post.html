        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. 
        In <dfn>sous vide cooking</dfn>, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature 
        you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30</time>.</p>
