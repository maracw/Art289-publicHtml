	<ul>
		<li>HTML Element Anatomy</li>
		<li>HTML Element Functions</li>
		<li>Semantic Use of HTML</li>
		<li>Heading elements</li>
		<li>Basic text formatting (paragraphs, emphasis, strong, etc.)</li>

<p>What's an HTML element?<br>
  Also referred to as as tags, HTML elements are special words enclosed in brackets that provide formatting and structure information for a document that will be displayed through software such as a Web browser.</p>
<p>Some people refer to HTML as code, or even programming, though it's really more of a &quot;light&quot; form of code known as Markup. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. When HTML is applied to a document, that process is known as &quot;marking up&quot; the document.</p>
<p>A typical HTML element has the following components:</p>
<p> A word, known as the name of the element (such as p, strong, h1 and so on)<br>
  Brackets enclosing the element name. These brackets are the &quot;less than&quot; and &quot;greater than&quot; symbols, like so: &lt;  and &gt;<br>
  The element's name and the brackets are combined to form tags. Every element has an opening tag: &lt;strong&gt;<br>
  After the opening tag of many elements is the content of that element. Content can be text or other HTML elements.<br>
  Most elements also have a closing tag, which look like these: &lt;/strong&gt;<br>
  Put those all together and you have an HTML element: &lt;strong&gt;<strong>POW!</strong>&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
  Elements can also have attributes, which are added into the opening tag: &lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;A paragraph with a class attribute.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
  And some elements are &quot;self closing&quot;, consisting only of an opening tag with a slash before its end bracket.&lt;img src=&quot;imagename.jpg&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>HTML Element Functions<br>
There are many HTML elements available for use, which can be grouped by the functions they perform:</p>
<p> Basic elements for defining an HTML document<br>
  Formatting text<br>
  Creating lists<br>
  Creating tables of information<br>
  Creating interactive areas, such as forms<br>
  Linking to other documents or files<br>
  Creating structure for layout<br>
  Adding images<br>
  Adding Cascading Style Sheets<br>
  Adding meta information to the document<br>
  Embedding scripts and multimedia objects<br>

<p>Semantic Markup<br>
  Put simply, semantic markup is using HTML elements for their intended purposes. It's a process that involves analysis of the content being marked up, making decisions about which elements are best suited for the different parts of a document, and applying those elements appropriately.<br>
  A good overview of semantic markup can be found here. (link the word &quot;here&quot; to http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/html-css/semantic-html)</p>
