		<h2>Pluto Revealed</h2>

	<p>Just 15 minutes after its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015, NASA&apos;s New Horizons spacecraft looked back toward the sun and captured this near&ndash;sunset view of the rugged, icy mountains and flat ice plains extending to Pluto&apos;s horizon. The New Horizons mission is helping us understand worlds at the edge of our solar system by making the first reconnaissance of the dwarf planet Pluto and by venturing deeper into the distant, mysterious Kuiper Belt &ndash; a relic of solar system formation.</p>

	<h2>The Journey</h2>

	<p>New Horizons launched on Jan. 19, 2006; it swung past Jupiter for a gravity boost and scientific studies in February 2007, and conducted a six&ndash;month&ndash;long reconnaissance flyby study of Pluto and its moons in summer 2015, culminating with Pluto closest approach on July 14, 2015. As part of an extended mission, the spacecraft is now heading farther into the Kuiper Belt to examine another of the ancient, icy mini&ndash;worlds in that vast region, <em>at least a billion miles beyond Neptune&apos;s orbit</em>.</p>

	<p>Sending a spacecraft on this long journey is helping us to answer basic questions about the surface properties, geology, interior makeup and atmospheres on these bodies.</p>

	<h2>New Science</h2>

	<p>The National Academy of Sciences has ranked the exploration of the Kuiper Belt &ndash; including Pluto &ndash; of the highest priority for solar system exploration. Generally, New Horizons seeks to understand where Pluto and its moons &quot;fit in&quot; with the other objects in the solar system, such as the inner rocky planets (Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury) and the outer gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).</p>
 
	<p>Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, belong to a third category known as &quot;ice dwarfs&quot;. They have solid surfaces but, unlike the terrestrial planets, a significant portion of their mass is icy material.</p>
 
	<p>A close&ndash;up look at these worlds from a spacecraft is telling an incredible story about the origins and outskirts of our solar system. <em>The images and data gathered by New Horizons is allowing us to explore &ndash; for the first time &ndash; how ice dwarf planets like Pluto and Kuiper Belt bodies have evolved over time</em>.</p>


	<h2>The Need to Explore</h2>

	<p>As the first voyage to a whole new class of planets in the farthest zone of the solar system, New Horizons is a historic mission of exploration. The United States has made history by being the first nation to reach every planet from Mercury to Neptune with a space probe. The New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt &ndash; the first NASA launch to a &quot;new&quot; planet since Voyager nearly 40 years ago &ndash; allows the U.S. to complete the initial reconnaissance of the solar system.</p>
